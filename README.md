My project is about building a neural network that combines CNNs and RNNs to recognize sequences of handwritten digits. 
I'm training it on concatenated MNIST images to figure out the correct order of the digits in each picture. 
I used multiple pairs of layers of Convolutional layers and pooling layers for the CNN and BiLSTM for RNN.  

After adjusting the parameters and epoch layers, I got an accuracy of over 99%.
